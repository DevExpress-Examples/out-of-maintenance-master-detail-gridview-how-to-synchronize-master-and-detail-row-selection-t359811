# Master-Detail GridView - How to synchronize master and detail row selection 
<!-- run online -->
**[[Run Online]](https://codecentral.devexpress.com/t359811/)**
<!-- run online end -->


<p>This example illustrates how to select all rows in the detail grid when the associated master grid row is selected. In addition, the opposite behavior is also implemented: if an end-user selects all rows in the detail grid, the associated master row becomes selected automatically.</p>
